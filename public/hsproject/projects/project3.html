                       <h5>Introduction</h5>
                       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my third POL I finished my original website and then completely rebuilt another one from the ground up while including things such as Javascript, PHP, cookies, and modular CSS style sheets. I also created a fully functioning snake leaderboard with the scores saved into a database. This project was also different from the others because in this one I did a lot of research on color schemes and picked out some of my favorites to use.</p>
                       <h5>Javascript</h5>
                       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javascript is an important language to learn when designing websites because it can transform a website and do many things that are impossible with traditional web design. HTML and CSS are technically not programming languages, but rather markup languages. This is because HTML/CSS only tell the browser what to display. The languages are unable to compute math expressions, declare variables, or manipulate data. Javascript differs from this because while it is also included in a website, it handles data like a traditional programming language does. An example of this can be seen on websites like <a href="http://calculator.com">http://calculator.com</a>. HTML/CSS are unable to compute anything with the numbers entered, so it is run in javascript. Therefore, any type of calculations are impossible to do using HTML/CSS.</p>
                       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking an AP Computer Science course last year, I already have some knowledge of Java (a language completely unrelated to javascript). Although this programming language can’t be used in web design, it gave me a good basis for learning Javascript. Since Javascript is a much more in depth language than the other ones I have been using, I only was able to learn the basics in the time allocated for this project. Using this knowledge, I was able to make my website much more user friendly and better looking.</p>
                       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing I did was take an open sourced snake game and modify it to fit into my website. I would have preferred to design it myself but it would be a project that I would have no hope of finishing within the time constraints given. The reason I added this game is so that I could explore databases and another language called PHP that I will get into in the next section.</p>
                       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I added to my website is the ability for the user to select which color scheme they would like to use and have it persist through each visit to the website. This was done by creating buttons that call a class that instantly swaps out the stylesheet for another one.  Every stylesheet is identical except the color HEX values are changed. I also used Javascript to give the effect of the selected button staying “pushed in” until another button is selected. The most difficult part of the color scheme project was getting the selected theme to persist between different pages and when reloading the page. This was done by storing a cookie with the title of the theme when the button is pressed, removing any previous cookies when another button is pressed, and checking for the cookie on page load then applying the selected stylesheet. This was very difficult for me to learn because cookies are confusing in the way that they work.</p>
                       <h5>PHP</h5>
                       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PHP is a programming/scripting language that is used to run commands on the server rather than on the client like the other ones I mentioned. PHP is also used to connect websites to databases. Databases can store, modify, and sort information. An example of when a database is used is on any website with username/passwords. In order to learn about PHP and databases, I decided to create a live updating leaderboard for the Javascript snake game I added earlier. The first thing I did was set up a database through my web host and teach myself to use the control panel in it. Next, I taught myself the basics of PHP. PHP looks very different from other languages but overall works in a similar way. In the snake game, I set the variables “topScore” and “tenthScore” equal to their respective places on the leaderboard. This allowed me to display a pop up after the game notifying the user if they are in the top ten or if they have the top spot and requesting a name to insert into the database. For the leaderboards page, I used a loop to display the top 10 scores and then styled them in a table with CSS.</p>
                       <h5>Core 4 Questions</h5>
                       <h6>What do I know now that I didn't know when I started my work?</h6>
                       <p>I am now more familiar with Javascript and PHP/databases. I also have an understanding of how websites can change things on the fly without reloading the page. Lastly, I now understand how websites can create leaderboards for games.</p>
                       <h6>What new questions do I now have?</h6>
                       <p>What are the possible job opportunities in the computer science field?</p>
                       <h6>What other areas, fields, or avenues do I need to investigate or pursue
in order to answer questions in #2?</h6>
                       <p>In my next POL I will explore job opportunities in this field.</p>
                       <h6>How can I share my knowledge with a wider audience?</h6>
                       <p>I can help other people make websites and help people classmates with coding.</p>
